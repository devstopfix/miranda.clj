# Functional Programming with Miranda in Clojure

This repository contains code examples in the functional style from the book [Functional Programming with Miranda][1] ([Dr Ian Holyer][2], 1991) translated from [Miranda][3] to [Clojure][4].

## Rationale

I took to [Clojure][4] very quickly and now realise it is because I was introduced the concepts of [funcional programming][5] and [lazy evaluation][6] way back in 1992 with the [Miranda Programming Language][3].
